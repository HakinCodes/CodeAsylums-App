journey.

### 2. Clone it :busts_in_silhouette:

`NOTE: commands are to be executed on Linux, Mac, and Windows(using Powershell)`

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Your_Username/CodeAsylums-App.git
```

> This makes a local copy of the repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the `CodeAsylums-App` repository in Github, move to that
folder first using change directory command on Linux, Mac, and
Windows(PowerShell to be used).

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder CodeAsylums-App
$ cd CodeAsylums-App
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

### 3. Set it up :arrow_up:

Run the following commands to see that _your local copy_ has a reference to
_your forked remote repository_ in Github :octocat:

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/CodeAsylums-App.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/Your_Username/CodeAsylums-App.git (push)
```

Now, let's add a reference to the original
[CodeAsylums-App](https://github.com/HakinCodes/CodeAsylums-App/) repository
using

```sh
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/HakinCodes/CodeAsylums-App.git
```

> This adds a new remote named **_upstream_**.

See the changes using

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/CodeAsylums-App.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/CodeAsylums-App.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/Remote_Username/CodeAsylums-App.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/Remote_Username/CodeAsylums-App.git (push)
```

`In your case, you will see`

```sh
$ git remote -V
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/CodeAsylums-App.git (fetch)
origin    https://github.com/Your_Username/CodeAsylums-App.git (push)
upstream  https://github.com/HakinCodes/CodeAsylums-App.git (fetch)
upstream  https://github.com/HakinCodes/CodeAsylums-App.git (push)
```

### 4. Sync it :recycle:

Always keep your local copy of the repository updated with the original
repository. Before making any changes and/or in an appropriate interval, run the
following commands _carefully_ to update your local repository.

```sh
# Fetch all remote repositories and delete any deleted remote branches
$ git fetch --all --prune

# Switch to `master` branch
$ git checkout master

# Reset local `master` branch to match the `upstream` repository's `master` branch
$ git reset --hard upstream/master

# Push changes to your forked `CodeAsylums-App` repo
$ git push origin master
```

### 5. Ready Steady Go... :turtle: :rabbit2:

Once you have completed these steps, you are ready to start contributing by
checking our `Help Wanted` Issues and creating
[pull requests](https://github.com/HakinCodes/CodeAsylums-App/pulls).

### 6. Create a new branch :bangbang:

Whenever you are going to contribute. Please create a separate branch using
command and keep your `master` branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```sh
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to branch Folder_Name
$ git checkout -b BranchName
```

Create a separate branch for contribution and try to use the same name of the
branch as of folder.

To switch to the desired branch

```sh
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git checkout BranchName
```

To add the changes to the branch. Use

```sh
# To add all files to branch Folder_Name
$ git add .
```

Type in a message relevant for the code reviewer using

```sh
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m 'relevant message'
```

Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using

```sh
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin BranchName
```

Finally, go to your repository in the browser and click on
`compare and pull requests`. Then add a title and description to your pull
request that explains your precious effort.
